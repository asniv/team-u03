Our program examines a set of COVID vaccination data in US states and federal entities. The dataset can be found here: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations

Packages need to run our code include:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Plotly
* Sklearn

We will use trends from the data to predict vaccination rates of future months.

To run our program, take these steps:
1. Open the 'Vaccine' folder above.
2. Open the 'Notebooks' folder.
3. Run the ### file.

From here, you will be able to observe various vaccination trends...

Model 1: The user will input a singluar state and observe the share of doses used over time.
Model 2: The user will have also have the option to input multiple states in order to compare trends administered doses between various locations.
Model 3: A side by side visual for administered doses and vaccination rate of selected states.

Our program  will then analyze these trends with a Linear Regression model
